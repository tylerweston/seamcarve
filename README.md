# seam carve lib

This is basically just turning the repo [here](https://github.com/AlexZeGamer/distort-video) into a module that can be imported into Python and used,
since I liked the functionality of the program but needed to use it by calling it from another Python script and passing it arguments.
I also removed the wobbly sound effect and added a few extra options that I specifically needed for my project.

# TODO:
- [ ] Add more tests to pytest
- [ ] Add more options for wiggling
- [ ] Potentially allow for other (Or maybe arbitrary, using Image Magick FX) effects besides seam carving
- [ ] Publish to PyPi
